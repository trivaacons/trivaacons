# About Us

about_us1: >
  TrivaaCons Ltd. was founded in 2015 by seasoned civil engineeers of the hungarian construction industry. Throughout the years we had to stand our
  ground in several implementation and design projects, usually among difficult circumstances. We'd like to offer our services with these valuable
  experiences gained. Nowadays, the construction industry is undergoing complex changes which often leave customers and investors confused.
  People who are not experienced in the subtle ways of this industry can quickly find themselves facing financial difficulties with their project.
  Unmet deadlines, exceeded budgets or end results of unacceptable quality are things many people have seen already and even more would like to avoid.
about_us2: >
  Our goal is to implement our Client's construction goals taking the current economical environment, budget and time limits all into consideration
  meanwhile aiming at achieving exceptional quality. As part of our services we stand available from the moment the designs are conceived until the
  building actually stands ready, thereby helping you through this maze we call the construction industry.

  Take a look at our references and get in contact with us if you are interested. As our Customer you can lean back and concentrate on the most
  important things. Let us do the heavy lifting to make the building you imagined a tangible reality!
